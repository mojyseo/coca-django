            <p>Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by The Coca-Cola Company. Originally marketed
                as
                a temperance drink and intended as a patent medicine, it was invented in the late 19th century by John
                Stith
                Pemberton and was bought out by businessman Asa Griggs Candler, whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to
                its
                dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century.[1] The drink's name refers to two
                of
                its original ingredients: coca leaves, and kola nuts (a source of caffeine). The current formula of
                Coca-Cola remains a trade secret; however, a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations
                have
                been published.</p>
